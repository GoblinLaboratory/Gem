Gem is a cross-platform game framework with GUI and multiplayer support using Monogame, Farseer and Lidgren

## Developement Progress

* Gem Network is not fully tested and not ready to use. See [Ginet](https://github.com/gmich/ginet) instead. 
* Gem Gui API is likely to change.
* Gem Engine is still in early development.

## Description

### Gem Network
A library for client server applications using network sockets. Gem Network extends Lidgren Network, offering an easy to use API for creating network events and a configurable and expendable server console for executing remote commands

Documentation for Gem Network can be found [here](https://github.com/gmich/Gem/wiki/Gem.Network)

### Gem GUI
A library to render [GUI controls](https://github.com/gmich/Gem/wiki/GemGui-Controls) in Monogame applications. 
Gem Gui supports the basic control events for mouse / keyboard / controller / touch. 
The control's style is easily customisable. 

Controls can be grouped into [GuiHosts](https://github.com/gmich/Gem/wiki/GemGui-Host) and show/hide them using the GemGui's screen management.

You can also assing controls into layout groups for automatic alignment that respond to window and resolution changes.
